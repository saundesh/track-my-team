# Track My Team!

Track My Team: A web app that will track all sports team events. This web app uses Django as the web framework and Python and Javascript.

## Week 1

### Requirements

#### Part 0: Tutorials

Sources I used for learning Django:
https://pythonprogramming.net/django-web-development-with-python-intro/
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/

#### Part 1: Navigation Bar

Create a navigation bar that will appear at the top of every page. This will allow the user to easily access the views.

#### Part 2: Signup and Login

Create signup and login forms on individual pages for users to create an account if they do not have one or to access their account if they do have an account. This week, it is okay if there are duplicate users that create an account.

#### Part 3: User Interface - Captains and Players

Captain
- Create a team profile
    - Create a roster within that team
    - Create a page to view all events (optional)

Player
- View team profile
    - View roster of team
    - Display a page to view all events (optional)

#### Part 4: Interacting with Django Database

Store the signup/login inputs, team profile information, and roster into the database. Retreive information stored in the database to display the team profile and roster for players, those who are not captains of a team.

#### Part 5: Testing

Create a manual test plan for this week. Write a test plan including screenshots and specific steps for a human tester to follow - what a tester should do and what he/she should observe.
