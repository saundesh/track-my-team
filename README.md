# Track My Team!

Track My Team: A web app that will track all sports team events. This web app uses Django as the web framework alongside Python and Javascript.

## Week 1

### Requirements

#### Part 0: Tutorials

#### Part 1: Navigation Bar

Create a navigation bar that will appear at the top of every page. This will allow the user to easily access the views.

#### Part 2: Signup and Login

Create signup and login forms on individual pages for users to create an account if they do not have one or to access their account if they do have an account. It is okay if there are duplicate users that create an account.

#### Part 3: User Interface - Captains and Players

Captain
- Create a team profile
    - Create a roster within that team
    - Create a page to view all events (optional)

Player
- View team profile
    - View roster of team
    - Display a page to view all events (optional)

#### Part 4: Interacting with Django Database

Store the signup/login inputs, team profile information, and roster into the database. Retreive information stored in the database to display the team profile and roster for players, those who are not captains of a team.

#### Part 5: Testing

Create a manual test plan for this week. Write a test plan including screenshots and specific steps for a human tester to follow - what a tester should do and what he/she should observe.

## Week 2

### Requirements

#### Part 1: User Interface - Captains

Improve the previous week's user interface. Figure out how to submit the forms and send data to database. Also, allow the team captains to be able to edit the team profile and roster. Create a team profile dashboard that will have access to the team roster and event pages.

#### Part 2: Displaying Event Page

Create a calendar or list view of all events happening in the team. The team captain should be able to add/remove and edit all events. Also, make it possible for events to be recurring. When editting recurring events, make sure it can change for just one event.

#### Part 3: Accessing Event Details

When events are clicked, all the details will display including: time and date, location, and event details. Also, import a map to show the location as well as allow for any attachments or notes to be uploaded with the event. For example, the workout of the week or drills worked on at practice.

#### Part 4: Player Profiles

Clicking on a players name in the team roster should open a new page with the player's profile, he/she will be able to edit their information and add an avatar. Also, redesign the team roster current page to be able to switch between a grid view with avatars and a list view.

#### Part 5: Testing

Expand the manual test plan for this week. Write a test plan including screenshots and specific steps for a human tester to follow - what a tester should do and what he/she should observe.
